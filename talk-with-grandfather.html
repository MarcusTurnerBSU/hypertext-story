                <p>Your grandfather tells you a story from his past. <br><br> <em>A group of us were looking for treasure in the temple, years ago. <br>We stumbled across a treasure map and a scroll with a riddle on it. We never found the time to explore the treasure map but the riddle said:<br><br><strong>If you break me I do not stop working; if you touch me I may be snared; if you lose me nothing will matter.</strong> The answer is: <strong>your heart.</strong></em></p>
